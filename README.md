# Processing-3DGlobe-TrumpTweets
This was my final project for a Data Visualization Class
 - Armand Post(https://github.com/armandpost)

// Description:

// The original idea was to pull tweets along with Latitude and Longitude and display on a 3D rendered globe.
// However, tweets could not be mined that had Latitude and Longitude attached.
// Data that consisted of major cities and their Latitude and Longitude were found at http://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities.
// A csv was downloaded from there and displayed on the globe.

// Another theme that was being explore was to somehow integrate tweets from Donald Trump.
// Some interaction was built in by obtaining a csv of tweets from http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive.
// Press T to make the Donald Trump twitter bird tweet.  X, Y, or Z resumes the earth's rotation.
